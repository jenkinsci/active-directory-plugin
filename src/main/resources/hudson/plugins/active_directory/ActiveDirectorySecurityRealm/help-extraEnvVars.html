    It may be necessary to set additional LDAP provider properties (<a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jndi/jndi-ldap.html">see the Oracle documentation for a full list</a>) in order to ensure optimum performance. Two specific values you should
    consider setting are:
    <dl>
        <dt><code>com.sun.jndi.ldap.connect.timeout</code></dt>
        <dd>The value is the number of milliseconds to use as the connection timeout. <br />
            <b>Note:</b> As of version 1.48 of the AD plugin this value has a default, if not set, of 30 seconds.
        </dd>
        <dt><code>com.sun.jndi.ldap.read.timeout</code></dt>
        <dd>The value is the number of milliseconds to use as the read timeout. <br />
            <b>Note:</b> As of version 1.48 of the AD plugin this value has a default, if not set, of 60 seconds
        </dd>
    </dl>
